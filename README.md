# 🧠 AI-Powered Company Insight Dashboard  
### 🚀 Milestone 1 – Data Collection & Insight Visualization

---

## 📘 **Project Overview**
The **AI-Powered Company Insight Dashboard** aims to collect, analyze, and visualize real-time insights about leading companies using multiple data sources.  
In this milestone, we focused on **data gathering, sentiment analysis, and interactive visualizations** to establish the foundation for intelligent company analysis.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**
To build an automated system that:
- Fetches company-related information from APIs (Wikipedia, NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage).  
- Analyzes recent news to determine **market sentiment**.  
- Visualizes trends, news, and stock performance interactively using **Plotly** and **Matplotlib**.  

---

## 🧩 **Milestone 1 Deliverables**
### ✅ Completed Tasks:
1. **Wikipedia Data Collection:**  
   Retrieved company background information programmatically.

2. **Simulated Google Trends Visualization:**  
   Created a mock 90-day trend chart showing search interest fluctuations.

3. **News Data Extraction (NewsAPI):**  
   Fetched and processed recent news headlines for multiple companies.

4. **Sentiment Analysis (TextBlob):**  
   Classified news headlines into *Positive*, *Negative*, and *Neutral* sentiments.

5. **Stock Price Analysis (Alpha Vantage):**  
   Visualized daily stock performance to show recent trends.

6. **Interactive Dashboard:**  
   Developed interactive bar, pie, and line charts for sentiment and trend analysis.

---

## 📊 **Key Insights**
- Combined **quantitative (stock)** and **qualitative (sentiment)** data for holistic company evaluation.  
- Identified patterns between public sentiment and company activity.  
- Set up a modular and scalable structure for future milestones (automation & real-time tracking).
